# gooby.cat

Personal webpage built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using [risotto](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto) theme, and deployed using Cloudflare Pages.

## Development

Clone this repo and install hugo using your system's package manager or with [this asdf plugin](https://github.com/nklmilojevic/asdf-hugo). If everything is okay, you should be able to start a development server (`hugo server`).

Any changes made to any files will be automatically reflected. Sometimes you may need to restart the server if you change something like favicons or theme stylesheets.

New posts should be added on the `/content/posts` folder as Markdown.

## TODO

- Add a new palette/color theme
- Properly configure `projects` taxonomy
- Add something *(ANYTHING!!)* on the right side bar, looks really lonely right now...
